# Send Activity Notification

Send an activity feed notification to a single [user](../resources/user.md), to all users in a [chat](../resources/chat.md), or to all users in a [team](../resources/team.md).

>**NOTE:** Currently, activity notifications sent via this API will only appear For users running Microsoft Teams Developer Preview on a web or desktop device. For more information, see [How do I enable Developer Preview](/microsoftteams/platform/resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro).

## Response

If successful, this method will return a `202 Accepted` response code. It does not return anything in the response body.

If there is more than one Teams app corresponding to a given Microsoft Graph app ID, this method will return a `409 Conflict` response code with the message `Found multiple applications with the same AAD App ID '{guid}' - a Teams Application ID is required to resolve which application is correct.` The message is misleading. There is no way to specify a Teams Application ID. You must disambiguate by uninstalling any conflicting Teams apps. Note that sideloading (uploading custom maps to a particular team, rather than to the app catalog) creates a new teams app and a new teams app ID.
